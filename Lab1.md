# Lab 100: Obtain a Workspace

## Introduction

Oracle APEX will run within your Autonomous Database. As a result, you will need to create an Autonomous Transaction Processing service and then access Oracle APEX from within the Service Console. 

When you first go into Oracle APEX you will need to log into Oracle APEX Instance Administration to create a workspace. A workspace is a logical domain where you define Oracle APEX applications. It is associated with one or more database schemas (database users) which is used to store the database objects, such as tables, views, packages, and functions, and more. These database objects are generally what you base the Oracle APEX applications on.
