# Lab 2: Create an App From a Spreadsheet

## Introduction

Now that you are logged into your workspace, you can start creating APEX applications. You will build a simple application based on a spreadsheet. However, APEX scales well, allowing you to also build large, sophisticated apps based on local database objects, REST enabled SQL objects, and even REST APIs.

Within the APEX development environment, you will spend the majority of your time in the App Builder. In your own time you should also investigate the SQL Workshop, where you can create and maintain database objects, Team Development, where you can track large APEX development projects, and the App Gallery, which contains numerous productivity and sample apps that can be installed within minutes.

When creating an application from a file, APEX allows you to drag and drop or upload CSV, XLSX, XML, or JSON files and then build apps based on that data. Alternatively, you can also copy and paste CSV data or load sample data. 

- Within the wizard, click **Copy and Paste**.
From the sample data set list select **Project and Tasks** and click **Next**.
